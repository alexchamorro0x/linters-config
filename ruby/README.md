# Ruby Course & Ruby on Rails Course

If you are not familiar with linters and Stickler, read [root level README](../README.md).

Please do the following **steps in this order**:

1. Install stickler-ci https://github.com/apps/stickler-ci
2. Enable stickler in your repo.
3. In first commit of your feature branch add a copy of [.stickler.yml](./.stickler.yml) and [.rubocop.yml](./.rubocop.yml) .
    - **Remember** to use both files linked above
    - **Remember** that `.stickler.yml` and `.rubocop.yml` file names start with a dot
4. When you open your first pull request you should see Stickler's report at `Checks` tab.


## Troubleshooting

1. `while scanning for the next token found character '\t' that cannot start any token` error.
    Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.
2. Stickler does not work and nothing helps ðŸ’¥ - run rubocop in your local env:
    - add `gem 'rubocop'` to `Gemfile` (not sure how to use Gemfile? Read [this](https://bundler.io/v1.15/guides/bundler_setup.html))
    - run `bundle install`
    - copy [.rubocop.yml](./.rubocop.yml) to the root directory of your project
    - run `rubocop`
